# vigenere

This is a variation on a project I did as a first year Computer Science student.
The original project was a rudimentary implementation of a Vigenere cipher using an A-F alphabet (single case).
I have modified my original design to use an alphabet of all printable 128-bit ASCII chars (32-126) not to include special chars.
